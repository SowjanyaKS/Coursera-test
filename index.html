			<h3 id="first">Chicken</h3>
			<p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.

			<h3>Beef</h3>
			<p>Beefs are relatively common in hip-hop culture, but controversial. Some see this as a bad role model for younger listeners and warn of possible escalations. Verbal combat ( battle rap ) is an elementary part of hip-hop culture, which often drives those involved to top musical performances. A beef undoubtedly increases the sales of the albums and mixtapes of both opponents and is therefore also an effective marketing strategy . The beef between Bushido and Sido increased media interest in the record labels Aggro Berlin and Ersguterjungeand most likely their sales figures.It is notable that commercially successful rappers like Bushido, Sido or Fler settle longstanding feuds even for a short time and can forge alliances against third parties.

			<h3>Sushi</h3>
			<p>Sushi is not an originally Japanese dish, but has its origins in a freshwater fish conservation method developed by residents along the Southeast Asian River Mekong .The gutted and cleaned fish was placed in boiled rice in vessels in which it was fermented . The rice, which had become sour due to the fermentation process, was thrown away before the fish was consumed. However, the fish so preserved was stable for up to a year.Starting from the Mekong River, this method of conservation also became popular in regions of China and spread from there to Japan. In China, this method of preservation has not continued to this day. But both Thailand and Taiwan still eat fish that have been preserved using this method.In China, this method of preservation has not continued to this day.
